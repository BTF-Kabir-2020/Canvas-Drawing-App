# Canvas Drawing Application

This is a feature-rich canvas drawing application built with React and Vite. Users can draw with various tools, select custom colors, and save their creations. The application stores user data locally, ensuring progress is never lost, even if the browser is refreshed or closed.

## Features

- **Color Palette**: Use a predefined color palette or select custom colors for your drawings.
- **Canvas Controls**: Clear the canvas or save your artwork as an image (supports transparent and non-transparent exports).
- **Persistent Data**: User data is stored in the browser's local storage, preserving your progress and tool settings.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully functional on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Export Options**: Download your drawings with or without transparency.
- **PWA Support**: The application works as a Progressive Web App, enabling offline usage and the ability to add to the home screen on mobile devices.
